This is scheme version of si, which is implemented according to http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-26.html and this version is mainly used to to help me understand the internal structure of interpreter, and when finished I will start to implementing the C version, which is the most exciting part of this project: implementing the language I'm like most in the language I'm most familiar with.
